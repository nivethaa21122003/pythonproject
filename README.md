project Title: Bank dataset
 Overview

This project involves analyzing a digital marketing dataset that includes customer demographics and campaign performance metrics. The main goal is to explore customer behavior, understand ad performance, and identify factors that lead to conversion. This project helps in building a foundation for predictive modeling such as conversion prediction or ROI estimation.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
CSV (Excel-compatible)
Scikit-learn (for optional ML modeling)
Git & GitHub (for version control)
Excel (for preliminary data checks)

Steps Performed
1. Data CollectionCreated/simulated a dataset with fields like name, age, gender, source, clicks, revenue, etc. 
2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing or duplicate entries
Validated email and age values

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of age, gender, country, and sources
Click-through rate (CTR) = clicks / impressions
Conversion rate = conversion / impressions
ROI = revenue / spend

4. Visualization
Bar charts for sources vs. conversion
Pie charts for gender distribution
Heatmaps for correlation

5. Optional Machine Learning
Built a simple classification model (Logistic Regression) to predict conversion

6. Conclusion
Key insights on which platform performed best
Recommended strategies to improve conversion


 Output
Cleaned and transformed dataset
Graphs and plots showing insights
CSV file ready for further modeling or reporting
Accuracy metrics (if ML was applied)
